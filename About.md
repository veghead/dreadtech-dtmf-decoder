Here is the source code, released under the GPLv3, for my iPhone DTMF decoder. Download it, build it and install it on your iPhone for free! If you'd rather not, or don't know how to do that, then you can buy it from the iTunes store for $0.99. If you like it - why not give it some positive feedback?
